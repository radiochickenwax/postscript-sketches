# postscript-sketches
Sketches in the postscript language

These postscript libraries are an attempt to distill and refine some hobby work over the past couple decades.  
This still has relevant use cases today, but it will take some thought, time and energy to scrape off the dust.

TODO:  add use cases, implications, images, etc.

Sample Use Cases:
1. Animating gifs
2. Making plots
   - 5.1 Bode plots https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Control_Systems/Bode_Plots
   - 5.2 Nyquist plots https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_plot
   - 5.3 Smith chart https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_chart
   - These were plot types that I needed to make quite often as an engineering student.  There were other ways to make them: i.e. MATLAB, python, etc... but they usually did not provide the level of control or speed that postscript did.
3. Making fonts
4. Brainstorming
5. Making highly performant math based UIs

6. Algorithm exploration and visualization
7. Language Design
